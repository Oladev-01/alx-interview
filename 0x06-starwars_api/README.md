# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Description

This project is focused on interacting with the **Star Wars API** (`swapi`) to fetch and display information related to the **Star Wars** universe. The goal is to retrieve and manipulate data about characters, starships, planets, and more using **Node.js** and **JavaScript**. 

By completing this project, you will improve your ability to handle asynchronous programming, make API requests, and process API responses.

## Features

- Fetch **Star Wars** character details from the **Star Wars API**.
- Display data such as character names and their associated starship, species, or planet.
- Efficiently handle asynchronous operations with `async/await` or `Promise`.
- Error handling to catch and manage issues during API requests.

## Requirements

### Mandatory
- Node.js must be installed (version 12 or higher is recommended).
- Install the necessary packages (using **npm**) like `axios` or `request` to handle HTTP requests.

## API Reference

This project interacts with the **Star Wars API (SWAPI)**:
- Base URL: `https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/api/`
- Endpoints include:
  - `/people/`: Get information about Star Wars characters.
  - `/planets/`: Get information about planets.
  - `/starships/`: Get information about starships.
  - `/species/`: Get information about species.

For more details about the API, visit [SWAPI documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/0x06-starwars_api.git
   cd 0x06-starwars_api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure `axios` or another HTTP request package is installed.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   To fetch and display data from the API:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Example Usage

Here is a sample of how the program might be used:

### Fetching Character Information:
```bash
$ node starwars.js 1
Character: Luke Skywalker
Planet: Tatooine
Starship: X-Wing, Imperial shuttle
```

## Concepts Learned

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Learn how to handle multiple API requests at once using Promises or `async/await`.
- **API Consumption**: Understand how to interact with RESTful APIs and process their data.
- **Error Handling**: Learn how to manage errors that occur during API requests.
