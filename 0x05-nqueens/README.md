# 0x05-NQueens

## Overview

The `0x05-NQueens` project is a solution for the N-Queens problem, which involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project aims to find all possible arrangements of N queens on the board where they do not share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- **Solves the N-Queens problem**: Computes all possible solutions for placing N queens on an N×N board.
- **Provides multiple solutions**: Returns a list of all valid configurations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x05-nqueens.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x05-nqueens
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed. No additional dependencies are required for this project.

## Usage

To run the solution, execute the provided script with the desired value of N:

```bash
python nqueens.py N
```

Replace `N` with the number of queens (e.g., `8` for an 8×8 board).

## Example

For `N=4`, running the script will output all valid configurations for a 4×4 board:

```bash
python nqueens.py 4
```
