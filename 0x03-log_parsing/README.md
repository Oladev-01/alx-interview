# 0x03. Log Parsing

## Description

This project focuses on parsing logs, simulating the generation of log entries, and processing them in real-time. The goal is to practice handling streaming input, processing data on the fly, and extracting useful information from log files.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn how to:

- Work with file I/O in Python.
- Process and parse log entries in real-time.
- Use string manipulation techniques to extract data.
- Handle edge cases and errors in data streams.
- Practice working with Python's standard libraries, such as `sys` and `datetime`.
- Implement logic to simulate server logs and process them efficiently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

## Features

- **Simulated Log Generation:** The script generates HTTP request logs, including random IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, and status codes.
- **Real-Time Log Parsing:** Parse logs as they are generated, extracting useful information like IP addresses, request types, and status codes.
- **Error Handling:** The script gracefully handles errors in log entries, ensuring robust performance even with unexpected input.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify the log generation and parsing logic to suit different scenarios or data formats.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd 0x03-log_parsing
   ```

2. **Run the Log Generator:**
   - Use the provided script to start generating log entries.
   - Logs are written directly to the console.

3. **Parse the Logs:**
   - The script processes each log entry as it appears, extracting and printing relevant information.

4. **Customize the Scripts:**
   - Modify the log generation parameters or parsing logic to fit your needs.

## Example Output

An example of the output generated by the script might look like this:

```
192.168.1.1 - [2024-08-28 14:05:33] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" 200 512
10.0.0.5 - [2024-08-28 14:05:34] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" 404 128
```
