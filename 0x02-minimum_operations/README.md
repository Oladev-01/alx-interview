## Description

This project is focused on finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific target number of 'H' characters in a text file. You can only perform two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste". The goal is to develop an algorithm that calculates the fewest number of operations necessary to reach a desired result.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Analyze and break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Implement algorithms to solve problems efficiently.
- Understand and apply the concept of dynamic programming.
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented Python code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PEP 8 coding style
- All files must be executable
- No use of external libraries unless explicitly permitted

## Project Files

- `0-minoperations.py`: The main Python file that contains the algorithm to compute the minimum number of operations.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
- `tests/`: A directory containing test files to validate the correctness of the algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version with:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

3. Make the Python file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 0-minoperations.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the `0-minoperations.py` script, run it from the command line with the target number of 'H' characters as an argument:

```bash
./0-minoperations.py <target_number>
```

Where `<target_number>` is the number of 'H' characters you want to achieve.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the script:

```bash
./0-minoperations.py 9
```

This will output the minimum number of operations required to get 9 'H' characters.

## Testing

To test the functionality of the script, you can use the test cases provided in the `tests/` directory.

Run the tests using:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

This will automatically find and run all test cases.
